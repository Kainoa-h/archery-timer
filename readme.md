# Single-File Web App Archery Timer

This project aims to be an extremely simple and portable compliant archery timer that mimics the Chronotir Timing System as closely as possible.

Using vite and [vite-plugin-singlefile](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile), this project builds into a single and easily portable .html file.

## Why html?

- Runs easily almost anywhere
- Accessible to less tech savvy people

## Dependencies

- vite 6.0
- npm
